The memory stores the program ’ s instructions and data
Computers also have another level of memory called a cache , a small , extremely fast ( compared with the main memory , or random access memory [ RAM ] ) unit that can be used to store information that is urgently or frequently needed
This instruction loads the contents of memory location 10 into the ALU
In general , programs are not just lengthy sequences of LOAD , STORE , and arithmetic operations
Computer architectures that can execute sequences of instructions , conditional instructions , and loops are called “ Turing complete , ” which means that they can carry out the execution of any algorithm that can be defined
Logic design is the area of computer science that deals with the design of electronic circuits using the fundamental principles and properties of logic ( see Boolean algebra ) to carry out the operations of the control unit , the ALU , the I/O controllers , and other hardware
Graphics and visual computing is the field that deals with the display and control of images on a computer screen
Medical imaging applications involve the visualization of data obtained from technologies such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRIs ) to assist doctors in diagnosing medical conditions
